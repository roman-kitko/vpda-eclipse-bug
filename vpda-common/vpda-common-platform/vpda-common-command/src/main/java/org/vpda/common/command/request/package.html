Provides contract for executing commands in client server environment.
Typically in gui environment, before each call to server, we need to execute some comamnd that e.g disable
some gui, than we execute concrete server functions (method call, command execution) and after success we need
to present data. 
 
<p>
There is one main class that encapsulates server execution from client side.
{@link org.vpda.common.core.command.request.AbstractRequestCommand} is abstract command we can use to execute request on server side
When creating new requeest, we can override this methods
<ul>
	<li>AbstractRequestCommand.executeRequest that will be executed on server side</li>
	<li>AbstractRequestCommand.executeBeforeRequest which can e.g disable client gui</li>
	<li>AbstractRequestCommand.executeAfterRequest which should present results</li>
	<li>AbstractRequestCommand.executeExceptionHandling which can handle exceptions</li>
	 
</ul>
